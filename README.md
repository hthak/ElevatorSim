**ELEVATOR SIMULATION PROJECT**

_This C++ project utilizes the built-in Allegro library to create a functional elevator simulation with a visual frontend interface connected to backend simulation logic. The simulation smoothly showcases an operational elevator system with realistic features and interfaces._

**FEATURES**\\
  Configurable Design
    - Easily adaptable to any number of floors
    - Created utilizing C++ best practices, leveraging creational and behavioral design patterns for modularity and maintainability
  Interactive Elevator Simulation
    - Fully functional floor buttons that light up based on floor requests
    - Passengers dynamically drawn on appropriate floor
    - Full ability to control timed passenger requests, passenger floor destinations, etc.
    - 60 fps visually moving elevator that transports passengers between floors
    - LED-style display showcasing the current floor and current elevator movement direction (up/down/idle)
    - Real-time progress bar and time display
    - Ability to pause the simulation and turn off all music

**REQUIREMENTS**
 - C++ Compiler: Compatible with Visual Studio 2022 or any modern C++ compiler
 - Allegro Library: Ensure the Allegro 5 library is installed and configured to the project destination

**DEMO**

\section*{Elevator Simulation Project}

This C++ project utilizes the Allegro library to create a functional elevator simulation with a visual frontend interface connected to a robust backend logic. The simulation dynamically showcases an operational elevator system with realistic features and interactions.

\section*{Features}

\textbf{Interactive Elevator Simulation:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Fully functional floor buttons that light up based on requests.
    \item Passengers dynamically drawn on each floor and moving towards the elevator.
    \item A visually moving elevator that transports passengers between floors.
    \item LED-style display showing the current floor and direction (up/down/idle).
    \item Real-time progress bar and time display.
    \item Ability to pause the simulation or turn off all background music.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Configurable Design:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Easily adaptable to different numbers of floors.
    \item Created with C++ best practices, leveraging \textit{creational} and \textit{behavioral design patterns} for modularity and maintainability.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Requirements}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{C++ Compiler:} Compatible with Visual Studio 2022 or any modern C++ compiler.
    \item \textbf{Allegro Library:} Ensure the Allegro 5 library is installed and configured for compilation.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Getting Started}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Install Allegro:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Follow the official \href{https://liballeg.org/}{Allegro installation guide} for your operating system.
        \item Ensure Allegro is properly linked in your Visual Studio 2022 project.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Clone and Build:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Clone this repository to your local machine.
        \item Open the project in Visual Studio 2022, ensuring all dependencies are correctly configured.
        \item Compile and run the project.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Demo:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item For a quick overview, see the attached \textit{demo.mov} file for a walkthrough of the project in action.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Development}

This project was developed using modern C++ techniques, including the implementation of design patterns to ensure maintainability, scalability, and clean code practices.
