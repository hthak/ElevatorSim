**ELEVATOR SIMULATION PROJECT**

_This C++ project utilizes the built-in Allegro library to create a functional elevator simulation with a visual frontend interface connected to backend simulation logic. The simulation smoothly showcases an operational elevator system with realistic features and interfaces._

**Features**

- **Configurable Design**
  - Easily adaptable to any number of floors
  - Created utilizing C++ best practices, leveraging creational and behavioral design patterns for modularity and maintainability
- **Interactive Elevator Simulation**
  - Fully functional floor buttons that light up based on floor requests
  - Passengers dynamically drawn on appropriate floors
  - Full ability to control timed passenger requests and passenger floor destinations
  - 60 fps visually moving elevator that transports passengers between floors
  - LED-style display showcasing the current floor and current elevator movement direction (up/down/idle)
  - Real-time progress bar and time display
  - Ability to pause the simulation and turn off all music

**REQUIREMENTS**

- C++ Compiler: Compatible with Visual Studio 2022 or any modern C++ compiler
- Allegro Library: Ensure the Allegro 5 library is installed and configured to the project destination

**DEMO**
